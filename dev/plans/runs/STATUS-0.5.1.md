_Last updated: 2026-06-26 (HITL kickoff answered; Phase A complete) · base branch: `feat/0.5.1-settings` (cut from `main` @ 91eabf7; `main` already contains the 0.5.0 train)_

Release: **settings coherence + the in-memory DualCache STORE-seam.** Plan:
`dev/plans/0.5.1-plan.md`. Orchestrator: `dev/plans/prompts/0.5.1-ORCHESTRATOR.md`.
Audit source-of-record: `dev/notes/architecture-audit-0.5.0-2026-06.md`.

## 1. Current pack in flight + next action

- **ALL 4 PACKS CLOSED + MERGED** on `feat/0.5.1-settings` (HEAD `845c84f`): SET-loader
  `6af83f7`, STORE-seam `93e15a2`, SET-unify `abb6194`, SET-warnratio `845c84f`. Each codex
  PASS/PASS-after-fix (CONCERNs fixed; one LOW metadata note overridden-with-rationale; no
  overridden BLOCK). Test-isolation fragility fixed (conftest autouse catalog reset).
  Behavior-change register (all 4) shipped in CHANGELOG. **Final 4-pack no-network suite
  (HEAD `845c84f`): 2182 passed, 73 skipped, 4 deselected, 0 failed (267s)** — incl. the e2e
  subprocess restart durability test.
- **Remaining for sign-off (engineering DONE):** **operator HITL** — run the live
  restart-durability + warn-ratio/budget-state/model-override smoke on a separate dir+port
  (copied config, never `:4000`) via `dev/smoketest/run_isolated_instance.sh` (billed calls +
  credentials → operator-run by design); then the DoD sign-off line + push/tag decision (needs
  explicit approval — nothing pushed/tagged yet).

## 0. Definition-of-Done checklist (release sign-off)

| # | DoD item | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | All 4 packs CLOSED w/ promoted codex PASS (CONCERN fixed or overridden-with-rationale; no overridden BLOCK) | ✅ |
| 2 | Acceptance: UN-25, UN-26, AC-R6, AC-R2, AC-0 all green | ✅ |
| 3 | Full no-network suite green on the target branch | ✅ 2182 passed / 0 failed (`845c84f`) |
| 4 | Durability proven by the e2e subprocess restart test (FIX-1 + Q3) | ✅ (no-network round-trip in `test_fast_spend_store.py`) |
| 5 | Behavior-change register shipped (4 entries) + config.yaml/template budget-doc note | ✅ (CHANGELOG #1–#4; note in SET-unify) |
| 6 | HITL kickoff questions answered + recorded | ✅ (§6) |
| 7 | `dev/smoketest/` extended + green on a separate dir+port (incl. spend-survives-restart); live `:4000` untouched | ⏳ **OPERATOR-RUN** (scenarios added; awaiting operator smoke) |
| 8 | Nothing pushed/tagged without approval; branch advanced locally; sign-off line written | ⏳ (branch local @ `845c84f`+docs; sign-off pending #7) |
- **Done:** kickoff cleared; Phase A (UN-25/26); Phase D PASS. **`SET-loader` CLOSED**
  (`6af83f7`). **`STORE-seam` CLOSED** (merged `93e15a2`; codex CONCERN→fixed; post-merge
  affected suites 230 green, proxy.py auto-merge verified). UN-26 engineering-complete
  (no-network subprocess round-trip durability passes); **live restart-durability smoke is a
  sign-off gate.** **`SET-unify` CLOSED** (R6/R2/AC-0 + budget-doc note; 27 shipped fallbacks
  all resolve to real model_list aliases).
- **Next action:** confirm full-suite green → dispatch the conftest test-isolation fix →
  spawn `SET-warnratio` (last critical-path pack) → release sign-off (smoke on separate port).

## 2. Pack scoreboard

| Pack | Goal (1 line) | Depends on | State | Witness |
|------|---------------|------------|-------|---------|
| `SET-loader` | One typed `AirlockSettings` read in place; uniform `env>config>default` (additive) | — | **CLOSED** (merged `6af83f7`; codex CONCERN→fixed) | `dev/plans/runs/0.5.1-SET-loader-output.json` |
| `SET-unify` | Delete hidden budget/failover defaults; fix R6; derive from config; budget-doc note | SET-loader ✅ | **CLOSED** (merged `abb6194`; codex CONCERN→fixed; HITL ACCEPTED) | `dev/plans/runs/0.5.1-SET-unify-output.json` |
| `SET-warnratio` | Collapse 0.8/0.9 into one configurable warn ratio | SET-unify ✅ | **CLOSED** (merged `845c84f`; codex 1 LOW overridden) | `dev/plans/runs/0.5.1-SET-warnratio-output.json` |
| `STORE-seam` | DualCache-backed store; rolling-window spend (R5); checkpoint-in-child (FIX-1) | — (∥) | **CLOSED** (merged `93e15a2`; codex CONCERN→fixed) | `dev/plans/runs/0.5.1-STORE-seam-output.json` |

States (furthest witnessed wins): `WORKTREE_CREATED` → `IMPLEMENTING` →
`IMPLEMENTED` (`output.json` + head past baseline) → `REVIEWED` (`*-review-*.md`
with a `## Verdict:`) → `MERGED` → `CLOSED` → `CLEANED`.

## 3. Acceptance / requirement scoreboard

| Requirement | Pack(s) | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| UN-25 — unified settings precedence (no hidden defaults) | SET-loader, SET-unify, SET-warnratio | ✅ (all 3 packs merged; precedence matrix + AC tests green) |
| UN-26 — accurate + durable spend (R5 + restart survival, FIX-1) | STORE-seam | ✅ eng-complete (no-network round-trip green; live smoke @ sign-off) |
| AC-R6 — monitor reads `router_settings` nesting | SET-unify | ✅ (regression test green) |
| AC-R2 — failover targets exist in `model_list` | SET-unify | ✅ (defaults removed + catalog-filtered) |
| AC-0 — `0 ⇒ no enforcement` across all three layers | SET-unify | ✅ (test + documented) |

## 4. Parallelization plan

`STORE-seam` runs ∥ the SET packs (disjoint files). Critical path:
`SET-loader → SET-unify → SET-warnratio`. **Serialize anything touching
`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`.** Max 3 worktrees per the runbook.

## 5. Outstanding worktrees

| Worktree path | Branch | Pack | State |
|---------------|--------|------|-------|
| _(SET-loader, STORE-seam, SET-unify all merged + cleaned)_ | | | |

## 6. HITL questions — ANSWERED at kickoff (2026-06-26)

| # | Question | Decision (operator) |
|---|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Keep both pre-call swap + LiteLLM `fallbacks`, or converge on one? | **Keep both, one shared target map** (both derive from `router_settings.fallbacks`). |
| 2 | Is multi-worker / horizontal scaling actually anticipated? | **Defer — not anticipated soon.** Build the seam in-memory + file-checkpoint; keep Redis a clean future config-flip, don't over-build. |
| 3 | Restore LiteLLM's hard-budget cache on restart if budgets>0 (FIX-2)? | **Accept reset while budgets are 0.** Scope restart-durability to Airlock warn/swap spend; LiteLLM-cache restore is a tracked follow-up if hard budgets return. |
| 4 | Working branch: stack on the train vs fresh branch? | **Fresh `feat/0.5.1-settings` off `main`** (`main` now fully contains `feat/0.5.0-resilience-admin`). |

Kickoff HITL gate **CLEARED**. Pre-`SET-unify`-merge behavior-change gate **CLEARED**
(operator accepted auto-swap-off, 2026-06-26). Remaining HITL gate: release sign-off — DoD
met + green isolated-instance smoke-test (incl. spend-survives-restart) on a separate dir+port.

## 7. Recent decisions (newest on top)

- 2026-06-26 — **HITL kickoff cleared + Phase A complete.** All four kickoff
  questions answered with the recommended options (§6). Cut `feat/0.5.1-settings`
  from `main` @ 91eabf7 (`main` supersedes the stale `feat/0.5.0` base). Committed
  the config.yaml budgets→0 baseline (`227a6b0`). Added **UN-25** (unified settings
  precedence) and **UN-26** (accurate + durable spend) to `dev/user-needs.md`.
  Next: Phase E — `SET-loader` + `STORE-seam` in parallel.
- 2026-06-26 — **Scaffolded for `/goal complete 0.5.1`:** added the lifecycle map,
  UN-25/UN-26 acceptance scoreboard, and production-ready DoD to the plan; authored
  this board + the orchestrator prompt. Phase D witnessed PASS (round 2) → release
  is Phase-E-ready pending HITL kickoff.
- 2026-06-24 — Scope set (user): config coherence (R1–R4) + in-memory DualCache
  STORE-seam; defer only the Redis backend + `--num_workers`. Design review PASS (r2).

## 8. Compaction-resume checklist

1. `AGENTS.md` 2. `MEMORY.md` (incl. [[airlock-production-safety]])
3. `dev/plans/0.5.1-plan.md` (register R1–R6, STORE-seam guardrails, acceptance)
4. `dev/plans/prompts/0.5.1-ORCHESTRATOR.md` (your operating contract)
5. **this file** §1+§2 6. `dev/plans/prompts/0.5.1-<pack>.md` (once authored).
Then re-derive each pack's state from witnesses before acting.
